## üöÄ Why TanStack DB?

TanStack DB gives you robust support for real-time sync, live queries and local writes. With no stale data, super fast re-rendering and sub-millisecond cross-collection queries ‚Äî even for large complex apps.

Built on a TypeScript implementation of differential dataflow ([#](https://github.com/electric-sql/d2ts)), TanStack DB gives you:

- üî• **a blazing fast query engine**<br />
  for sub-millisecond live queries &mdash; even for complex queries with joins and aggregates
- üéØ **fine-grained reactivity**<br />
  to minimize component re-rendering
- üí™ **robust transaction primitives**<br />
  for easy optimistic mutations with sync and lifecycle support
- üåü **normalized data**<br />
  to keep your backend simple

TanStack DB is **backend agnostic** and **incrementally adoptable**:

- plug in any backend: sync engines, polling APIs, GraphQL, custom sources
- builds on [TanStack Store](https://tanstack.com/store), works with and alongside [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query)

## üí• Usage example

Sync data into collections:

```ts
import { createElectricCollection } from '@tanstack/db-collections'

// You can configure any strategy you like to load data into
// collections. Here we're using the Electric sync engine.
export const todoCollection = createElectricCollection<Todo>({
  id: 'todos',
  streamOptions: {
    url: 'https://example.com/v1/shape',
    params: {
      table: 'todos'
    }
  },
  primaryKey: ['id'],
  schema: todoSchema // standard schema interface
})
```

Bind live queries to your components:

```tsx
import { useLiveQuery } from '@tanstack/react-optimistic'

const Todos = () => {
  const { data: todos } = useLiveQuery(query =>
    // You can query across collections with where clauses,
    // joins, aggregates, etc. Here we're doing a simple query
    // for all the todos that aren't completed.
    query
      .from({ todoCollection })
      .where('@completed', '=', false)
      .select('@id', '@text')
      .keyBy('@id')
  )

  return <List items={ todos } />
}
```

Define a `mutationFn` to handle persistence of local writes:

```tsx
import type { Collection } from '@tanstack/optimistic'
import type { MutationFn, PendingMutation } from '@tanstack/react-optimistic'

const filterOutCollection = (mutation: PendingMutation) => {
  const { collection: _, ...rest } = mutation

  return rest
}

// You can handle mutations any way you like. Here, we define a
// generic function that POSTs them to the server.
const mutationFn: MutationFn = async ({ transaction }) => {
  const payload = transaction.mutations.map(filterOutCollection)
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
  })

  if (!response.ok) {
    // Throwing an error will rollback the optimistic state.
    throw new Error(`HTTP Error: ${response.status}`)
  }

  const result = await response.json()

  // Wait for the transaction to be synced back from the server
  // before discarding the optimistic state.
  const collection: Collection = transaction.mutations[0]!.collection
  await collection.config.sync.awaitTxid(result.txid)
}
```

Use it in your components:

```tsx
import { useOptimisticMutation } from '@tanstack/react-optimistic'

const AddTodo = () => {
  const tx = useOptimisticMutation({ mutationFn })

  const addTodo = () => {
    // Triggers the mutationFn to sync data in the background.
    tx.mutate(() =>
      // Instantly applies the local optimistic state.
      todoCollection.insert({
        id: uuid(),
        text: 'üî• Make app faster',
        completed: false
      })
    )
  }

  return <Button onClick={ addTodo } />
}
```

For transactional writes with local optimistic state and managed background sync.

## üß± Core concepts

### Collections

- typed sets of objects that can mirror a backend table or be populated with a filtered view or result set, such as `pendingTodos` or `decemberNewTodos`
- collections are just JavaScript data &mdash; load them on demand and define as many as you need

### Live Queries

- run reactively against and across collections with support for joins, filters and aggregates
- powered by differential dataflow: query results update incrementally, not by re-running the whole query

### Transactions

- batch and stage local changes across collections with immediate application of local optimistic updates
- sync to the backend using flexible mutationFns with automatic rollbacks and management of optimistic state

## üîß Install

```bash
npm install @tanstack/db
```

## üìö Docs

See the [Documentation](./docs/index.md) for usage guides and the API reference.

There's also an example [React todo app](./examples/react/todo).

## ‚ùì FAQ

**How is this different from TanStack Query?**<br />
TanStack DB builds *on top of* TanStack Query. Use Query to fetch data; use DB to manage reactive local collections and mutations. They complement each other.

**Do I need a sync engine like ElectricSQL?**<br />
No. TanStack DB *is* designed to work with sync engines like [Electric](https://electric-sql.com) but *also* works with any backend: polling APIs, GraphQL, REST, or custom sync logic.

**What is a Collection? Is it like a DB table?**<br />
Kind of. Collections are typed sets of objects, but they can also be filtered views or custom groupings. They're just JavaScript structures that you define and manage.

**Is this an ORM? Do queries hit my backend?**<br />
No. TanStack DB is not an ORM. Queries run entirely in the client against local collections. The framework provides strong primitives to manage how data is loaded and synced.
